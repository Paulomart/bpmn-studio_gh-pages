## Rules

Checkout the [`./rules` folder](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint/tree/master/rules) for the list of existing rules.


## Configuration

Create a `.bpmnlintrc` file in your working directory and inherit from a common configuration using the `extends` block:

```json
{
  "extends": "bpmnlint:recommended"
}
```

Add or customize rules using the `rules` block:

```json
{
  "extends": "bpmnlint:recommended",
  "rules": {
    "label-required": "off"
  }
}
```


## Visual Feedback

Integrate the linter via [bpmn-js-bpmnlint](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-bpmnlint) into [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) and get direct feedback during modeling.

To try out visual validation, checkout the [bpmnlint playground](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint-playground).


## Writing / Consuming Custom Rules

Use the [bpmnlint playground](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint-playground) to implement new rules with quick visual feedback.

For more details on how to define and consume custom lint rules check out the [bpmnlint-plugin-example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmnlint-plugin-example).
