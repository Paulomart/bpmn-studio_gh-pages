 * Describes a BPMN ReceiveTask.

 * A ReceiveTask is basically the opposite of a SendTask.
 * It will block the Process Execution, until an expected Message is
 * received.
 *
 * In contrast to an IntermediateCatchEvent, a ReceiveTask will
 * throw back a confirmation Message that the ReceiveTask received the
 * defined message.
 * Therefore, a ReceiveTask will only accept messages, that where send by
 * a SendTask.
