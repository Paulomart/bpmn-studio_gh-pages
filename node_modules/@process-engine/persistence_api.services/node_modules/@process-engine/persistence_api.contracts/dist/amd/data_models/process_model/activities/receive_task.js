     * A ReceiveTask is basically the opposite of a SendTask.
     * It will block the Process Execution, until an expected Message is
     * received.
     *
     * In contrast to an IntermediateCatchEvent, a ReceiveTask will
     * throw back a confirmation Message that the ReceiveTask received the
     * defined message.
     * Therefore, a ReceiveTask will only accept messages, that where send by
     * a SendTask.
