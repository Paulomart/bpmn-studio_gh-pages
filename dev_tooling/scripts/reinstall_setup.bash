# This script reinstalls the current developement setup by:
#   * Deletes the node_modules directory
#   * Clears the NPM - Cache
#   * Reinstalling all required node modules (the package-lock file is accounted for and must exist)
#   * Rebuilding
#
# Note: Please DO NOT ADD THIS SCRIPT TO THE Jenkinsfile!
#
# This script is meant to give you, the human developer, a convenient way, to
# reinstall your setup. Adding this script to the jenkinsfile would not make
# that much sense, because:
#   * The Jenkins *should* offer a clean setup anyway
#   * The Jenkins already executes npm install (Since npm does not seems to that
#     consistent, a multiple execution of npm install may lead to an undefined
#     behavior and is pointless anyways.
